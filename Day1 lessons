1. Variables:

Variables are used to store and manage data in a program. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords.

// Using var (older way)
var myVar = 10;

// Using let (introduced in ES6, allows reassignment)
let myLet = 'Hello';

// Using const (introduced in ES6, constant, cannot be reassigned)
const myConst = 3.14;

2. Primitive Data Types:

JavaScript has several primitive data types, including number, string, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol.

let num = 42; // number
let greeting = 'Hello, World!'; // string
let isTrue = true; // boolean
let nothing = null; // null
let notDefined; // undefined
let uniqueID = Symbol('id'); // symbol

3.Objects:

Objects are used to group related data and functions. They consist of key-value pairs.

// Object literal
let person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 25,
  isStudent: false
};

4.Operators and Expressions:

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Expressions are combinations of values and operators.

let a = 5;
let b = 10;

let sum = a + b; // Addition
let product = a * b; // Multiplication
let isGreater = a > b; // Comparison

5. Conditional Expressions:

Conditional statements allow you to execute different code based on different conditions.

let age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log('You are an adult.');
} else {
  console.log('You are a minor.');
}


6.Switch:

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

let day = 'Monday';

switch (day) {
  case 'Monday':
    console.log('It\'s the start of the week.');
    break;
  case 'Friday':
    console.log('TGIF!');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('It\'s a regular day.');
}
